    "The aim is to test if the difference of brain signal during the two conditions is different from $0$ for each time points, i.e., $500$. If the full set of channels is considered, we have also test for each channel, i.e., $27$, returning a total number of tests equals $500 \\cdot 27$. Therefore, we have $500$ or $500 \\cdot 27$ statistical tests to perform at group-level, so considering the **random subject effect**. The multiple testing problem is then obvious, and correction methods as Bonferroni or similar don't capture the time(-spatial) correlation structure of the statistical tests, the cluster mass method, proposed by [Maris and Oostenveld, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.03.024), is then used. It is based on **permutation theory**, and it gains some power respect to other procedure correcting at level of (spatial-)temporal cluster instead of at level of single tests. It is similar to the cluster mass in the fMRI framework, but in this case, the *voxels*, i.e., the single object of the analysis, are expressed in terms of time-points or in terms of combination time-points/channels. The method is then able to gain some power respect to some traditional conservative FWER correction method exploiting the (spatial-)temporal structure of the data.\n",

We assign to each time point in the same cluster $C_i$, the same cluster-mass statistic $m_i = f(C_i)$ where $f$ is a function that aggregates the statistics of the whole cluster into a scalar; typically the sum of the $F$ statistics or the sum of squared of the $t$ statistics. The cluster-mass null distribution $\\mathcal{M}$ is computed by repeating the process described above for each permutation. The contribution of a permutation to the cluster-mass null distribution is the maximum over all cluster-masses for this permutation. To test the significance of an observed cluster Ci, we compare its cluster-mass $m_i = f(C_i)$ with the cluster-mass null distribution $\\mathcal{M}$. The p-value of the effect at each time within a cluster $C_i$ is the p value associated with this cluster, i.e. \n",

    "## Spatial-temporal Cluster mass \n",

    "In this case, we will use the theory of graph, where the vertices represent the channels, and the edges represent the **adjacency** relationship. The adjacency must be defined using prior information, therefore the three-dimensional Euclidean distance between channels is used. Two channels are defined adjacent if their Euclidean distance is less than a threshold $\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the smallest euclidean distance that produces a connected graph. This is due to the fact that a connected graph implies no disconnected sub-graph. Having sub-graphs implies that some tests cannot, by design, be in the same cluster, which is not a useful assumption for this analysis. ([Frossard and Renaud, 2018](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/permuco/vignettes/permuco_tutorial.pdf); [Frossard, 2019](10.13097/archive-ouverte/unige:125617)).\n",

The final graph has a total of vertices equals to the number of tests ($n_{\\text{channels}} \\times n_{\\text{time-points}}$). The following figure represents the case of $64$ channels and $3$ temporal measures:\n",

So, we have a new graph composed of **multiple connected components**. Then, each connected component is interpreted as a spatial-temporal cluster. Finally, for each connected component, we compute the cluster-mass statistic using the sum (or sum of squares) of statistics of that particular connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster-mass null distribution is computed by permutations while maintaining spatial-temporal correlations among tests. Permutations must be performed without changing the position of electrodes nor mixing time-points. Concretely, after transforming the responses using the permutation method in [Kherad Pajouh and Renaud, 2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00362-014-0617-3), they are sorted in a three-dimensional array. It has the design (subjects $\\times$ stimuli) in the first dimension, time in the second one and electrodes in the third one. Then, only the first dimension is permuted to create a re-sampled response (or 3D array). Doing so, it does not reorder time-points, neither electrodes, therefore, the spatial-temporal correlations are maintained within each permuted sample.\n"
